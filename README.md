# Speaker-Identification-System-Using-ECAPA-TDNN
This project implements a speaker identification system using the ECAPA-TDNN model and cosine similarity. Speaker embeddings are extracted with SpeechBrain, and a GUI-based application is developed to perform speaker enrollment and recognition using a pretrained VoxCeleb model.
